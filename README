JSBase Framework

A lightweight JavaScript framework for creating typical web applications. Intended to be way lighter than something
like Ext JS, while at the same time providing some best practice Javascript and IDE/MVC structure to keep components
decoupled via notifications, etc.

This is very, very much a work in progress at this point.
